		  <h2> by Jennifer </h2>
			<p> This website was inspired by the ever-changing weather that we experience. The sky is full of surprises, and through scrolling down the page, you can see some of the different forms that the sky takes. When you hover over a gif, it will zoom in to the point that you see animated pixels of colors. These colors blend into the background gradation.
